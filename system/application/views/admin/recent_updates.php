    <ul>
      <li><strong>E-mail List Addresses Changed</strong> - The e-mail address for your e-mail lists that work through Sampark System have been changed. For example, instead of madhav-shakha@hssusa.org in past, now you would have send the e-mails to madhav-shakha@lists.hssusa.org! Everything else is same as before. Only addresses have changed.</li>
      <li><strong>New URL for Sampark System</strong> - The Sampark (CRM) System will be available on its new URL http://sampark.hssusa.org! The old URLs will redirect you to the correct ones. So, if you use bookmarks to access the Sampark System, don't forget to update your bookmarks for faster access.</li>
		<li><strong>Moved to New Server</strong> - The Sampark System has moved to its own dedicated server (previously it was on a VPS). This gives us more flexibility and power. One major benefits would be that E-mail Lists will now be automatically created upon a request, within a hour maximum!! Now, there would be no need to wait for me to create it manually.</li>
		<li><strong>Improvements in Junk E-mail</strong> - Many people in past had mentioned that Emails from our email lists were going to Bulk Mail folder of Yahoo. I have implemented the following features on our E-mail system SenderID, SPF, DKIM, Domain-Keys, RDNS, which should prevent e-mails going to Junk or Bulk Mail folder. Let me know if the issue still persists.</li>
